## About

This application is a part of a content management system.

Built with GraphQL-Yoga and Prisma.

Prisma runs on a Docker container. You can checkout an example `docker-compose.yml` file on [Prisma's documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/1.23/get-started/01-setting-up-prisma-new-database-JAVASCRIPT-a002/#add-prisma-and-database-docker-images).

A `.env` file like the example below should be added on project's root directory.

```
PRISMA_ENDPOINT=YOUR_PRISMA_ENDPOINT
PRISMA_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET
FRONTEND_URL=YOUR_FRONTEND_URL
```
